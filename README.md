# OurSonicTyped

Our Sonic written in typescript using AWS Lambda.

A full simulation of the original 2d sonic games built specifically for the web. Data is derived from the original game, and physics were built primarily using http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide. 

This project is also a full level editor allowing players to create their own sonic levels for sharing with friends.
